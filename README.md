## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
1. Simply open `home/home.html` in your web browser to start
2. Navigate through the website using the buttons
3. All pages are interconnected and work offline

### Backend (Python Flask) - Optional
For enhanced AI responses, set up the Python backend:

1. **Install Python** (3.7 or higher)
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. **Server will run on**: `http://localhost:5000`

### Connecting Frontend to Backend
To use the Python backend instead of the basic JavaScript responses:
1. Update the `generateResponse()` function in `me/me.html`
2. Replace the basic keyword matching with API calls to `http://localhost:5000/api/chat`
